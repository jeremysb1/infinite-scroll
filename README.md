# Infinite Scroll

This vanilla JavaScript project uses the Unsplash API to load photos and allows the user to scroll infinitely.

The purpose of this project was to get more practice with a 3rd party API and learn to use infinite scroll in an application or website.

While a good learning opportunity, this is too simple to put on a portfolio.
